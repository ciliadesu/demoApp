## Running the project
To run this project, clone it from github, open in Xcode, compile and run!

## What the project does
This is a basic project to display an example of fetching a JSON, decoding it, and parsing out relevant data. It then uses this data to populate a searchable list.
When no search terms have been entered the full list is displayed, and as a user inputs a search string the search results are filtered to show only relevant items.

## Unit tests
The project includes a couple of unit tests that tests json parsing, creating the data model, and picking out some information frmo the data model. For testing purposes only, a copy of the JSON file is included in the project.
To run tests open the project in Xcode, go the the Test navigator, and run the test class DemoAppTests.
